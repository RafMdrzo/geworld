            <h2>What is <u>interconnectedness</u> ?</h2>
            <p class = 'p-less'>The Cambridge Dictionary (n.d.) defines interconnectedness as <u class = 'highlighter1'>“the state of having different parts or things connected 
                or related to each other”.</u> It is the condition where events from completely far and different circumstances have spillover 
                effects to people in different places. These spillover effects may be negative or positive. Either way, it is <u class = 'highlighter1'>significant in 
                affecting the lives of other people (Heywood, 2011). </u></p>

            <h2>What is <u>interdependence</u> ?</h2>
            <p class='p-less'>
                It is defined as <u class='highlighter2'>“the fact of depending on each other” (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.).</u> According to Heywood (2011), two parties are bound in a relationship where a decision 
                made by either of the parties would have an <u class='highlighter2'>influence on the other party.</u> 
                <br><br>
                This is said to have stemmed from the sense of mutual vulnerability. 
                It is commonly observed in world politics where countries would enter into economic <u class='highlighter2'>cooperation and integration to address issues together.</u>

            <p class='p-more'>
                The world today seems to have shrunk as events in distant places have shown <u class='highlighter3'>repercussions to the life of people across the globe (Heywood, 2011 : Bova, 2012). </u>
                In recent years, advanced technology in transport and communication have closed <u class='highlighter3'>the gap on distance between borders (Bova, 2012).</u> 
                <br><br>
                Within the context of today’s global landscape, our interconnectedness has  <u class='highlighter3'>migrated to a new medium— the internet.</u> 
                With the risks involved in going outside due to the ongoing pandemic, the safest means to connect to <u class='highlighter3'>the world is online.</u> 
                Work, studies, investments, and more have shifted to an online platform, highlighting <u class='highlighter3'>the link that binds us to the world.</u>

            <p class='p-more'>
                Economic cooperation and integration among nations has changed the landscape of trade and commerce. Today, we can observe the interdependence of ASEAN countries in trade where inter-regional tariffs 
                were remarkably cut under the  ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) (ASEAN, n.d.).  
                <br><br>
                Right now, we can observe interdependence with the <u class = 'highlighter1'>global effort in vaccine production and circulation.</u> Research and development on attaining methods to reduce the spread of COVID is <u class='highlighter1'>shared with the global community</u>, 
                establishing the fact that the world is <u class='highlighter1'>united against a common threat.</u> This signifies that dependence exceeds the needs of man but <u class='highlighter1'>as a collective whole.</u>

                Within the context of interconnectedness and interdependence, it’s up to us, the residents of our country and this world, to wear masks, get vaccinated, and so much more.
